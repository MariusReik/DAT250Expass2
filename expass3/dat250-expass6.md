DAT250 ASSIGNMENT 3: SPA

Group members:
- Marius Reiker√•s

  Installation
- Small issues with an outdated node when running vue, but a quick redownload fixed the issue.

Development
- I choose to use Vue.js over Svelte since I want to learn Vue.js properly and i have a bit of experience using it.
- Overall the development went fine, I had a few issues with CORS and with connecting the frontend and backend. 
But after reading up on CORS I understod my mistake and fixed it.
- For connecting frontend and backend, i had some trouble with configuring both vue's default port and connecting 
backend and frontend togheter but after reading some documentation aswell as looking at the network tab in localhost/5167 
and using that as a sort of debugger.
